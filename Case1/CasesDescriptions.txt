Case 1:

- Method extractions
- Inline Variables
- Extracting variables
- Extract temporary variables to functions

	- Split loop
	- Slide Statements
	- Extract function
	- Inline Variables


Useful code refactoring techniques:
- Split loop: to isolate the processing of collections. It facilitates the principle of single responsibility and separation of concerns.
- Slide Statements: to lift the initialization code. It can help to know what is happening in the code and gain new insights.
- Extract Functions: moves a piece of code from an existing method to a new method with a name that explains what it is doing. This technique can be used to reduce complexity and improve code readability.
- Inline variables: to completely remove a variable. Allows you to replace all occurrences of a variable in code with its initializer.
- Split Phases - Separate logic in parts
